### 🎓 Assignment Description: Grading Program

The program should calculate the average of 8 test scores and display the corresponding letter grade.

#### Functions to Implement

1. **`calc_average`**  
   Prompts for 8 test scores and returns the average.

2. **`determine_grade`**  
   Accepts the average score and returns the corresponding letter grade based on this scale:

   | Score Range | Grade |

### 📋 Program Overview
This program allows users to input eight test scores, calculates the average, and then displays a corresponding letter grade based on that average.

### 📝 Code Breakdown

- **`calc_average()` Function** 🧮  
  Prompts the user to enter eight scores, calculates the sum of these scores, and returns the integer average. This function gathers all scores in a single line using a loop within a summation.

- **`determine_grade(score)` Function** 🎓  
  Accepts the average score as input and returns a letter grade. The function uses a series of conditional checks to assign letter grades:
    - **A** 🅰️ for scores 90 and above
    - **B** 🅱️ for scores 80-89
    - **C** 🟩 for scores 70-79
    - **D** 🟨 for scores 60-69
    - **F** 🟥 for scores below 60

- **`main()` Function** ⚙️  
  Calls `calc_average()` to get the average score, passes that average to `determine_grade()`, and prints the final letter grade to the user.

- **`__name__` Check** ✅  
  Ensures that the program runs only if executed directly, not when imported as a module.
